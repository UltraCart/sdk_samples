    * Note: You will never call this method from any sdk. This method is not meant to be called from your application.
    * Our sdk_samples are auto generated by our framework. Therefore, this sample file was created automatically.
    * But, this is not a sdk function. The underlying endpoint is what your application should direct users to in order
    * to authorize your application.
    * 
    * The first step in implementing an OAuth authorization to your UltraCart Developer Application is
    * creating a Client ID and Secret. See the following doc for instructions on doing so:
    * https://ultracart.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ucdoc/pages/3488907265/Developer+Applications+-+Creating+a+Client+ID+and+Secret+for+an+OAuth+Application
    * 
    * Once you have your Client ID and Secret created, our OAuth security follows the industry standards.
    * 1. Construct an authorize url for your customers.
    * 2. Your customers will follow the link and authorize your application.
    * 3. Store their oauth credentials as best fits your application.
    * 
    * This sample shows how someone might construct the authorize url. Note that we don't provide the scope here.
    * We set the scope when we created the developer application (generated client id and secret). See the above doc link
    * for details.
