*The StoreFrontApi is an internal API*.

The StoreFront API is a publicly available, but it was written for internal use.
A few years ago, UltraCart decided to make our REST API our centerpiece and started 
using the API for all new backend screens.  The StoreFronts use the APIs heavily.

We cannot envision a use-case for a merchant to use the StoreFrontApi.

You can if you like, but we just don't see a use for it externally.

For that reason, we have not included any samples for the StoreFrontApi methods.

If you think you have a use for something here, contact us and let's talk.  Maybe you do.  We'll help you either way.
