// The TaxRestApi is used internally by UltraCart for our own UI.
// We don't know of a use-case for merchants to use this API in their own automation,
// but it's a public part of our REST API.
//
// We're not including any examples for using the Tax Api, but if you find yourself needing it for some reason,
// contact us and we'll assist.  But again, we doubt merchants will ever have a need for this API.
