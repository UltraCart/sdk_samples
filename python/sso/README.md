*The SSO API is deprecated*.

At UltraCart, we try our very best to never remove an API once it's public.  So we've left the SSO in place, but
we don't envision a scenario where a merchant would need it given our modern API authentication options.

Therefore, we have not included any samples for the SSO API.
